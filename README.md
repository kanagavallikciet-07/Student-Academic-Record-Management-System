# Student-Academic-Record-Management-System

📌 Project Overview



      Maintaining student academic records is a critical task in every educational institution.
      As the volume of data grows and changes frequently, static storage methods such as spreadsheets become inefficient.

      This project implements a dynamic Student Academic Record Management System using Doubly Linked Lists in C.
      It allows efficient insertion, deletion, searching, displaying, reversing, cloning, and calculating the average GPA of students.

      The goal of this system is to demonstrate the use of dynamic data structures for handling frequently changing data.


 🚀 Features


      ✔️ Insert new student records dynamically.
      
      ✔️ Delete a student by their ID.
      
      ✔️ Search for students by ID or Name.
      
      ✔️ Display all student records in order of entry.
      
      ✔️ Reverse display of student records (using doubly linked list).
      
      ✔️ Clone the list to create a backup copy.
      
      ✔️ Calculate the average GPA of all students.     


🧱 Data Structure Used


 🔹 Doubly Linked List
 
          typedef struct Student {
             int id;
             char name[50];
             char dept[30];
             float gpa;
             struct Student *prev, *next;
          } Student;

          

 Each student record is a node in the doubly linked list.

      * prev pointer points to the previous record.
      * next pointer points to the next record.
